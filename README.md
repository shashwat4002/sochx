# SochX — Landing

This commit adds a Next.js + Tailwind starter to match the requested reference site look & feel.

Notes:
- I preserved references to your existing logo at `/logo.png` (or `/logo.svg`) — if you already have a logo in public/, it will be used. If not, the text fallback displays.
- The project is ready for Vercel. Deploy by pushing to main (already pushed) and linking the repository in Vercel.

Commands:
- npm install
- npm run dev
