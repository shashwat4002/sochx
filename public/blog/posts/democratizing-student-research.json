Every student with curiosity and drive deserves the opportunity to engage in meaningful academic work.</p><br><h2>The Problem</h2><br><p>Too many talented students lack access to research opportunities simply because of where they live or who they know. Traditional research programs are often limited by geography, connections, or financial barriers.</p><br><h2>Our Solution</h2><br><p>SochX connects students with high-quality research opportunities worldwide. We're building a platform where:</p><br><ul><li>Students can discover opportunities matched to their interests</li><li>Researchers can find passionate collaborators</li><li>Quality trumps connections</li></ul><br><h2>Join Us</h2><br><p>Whether you're a student looking for opportunities or a researcher willing to mentor, we'd love to have you be part of this movement.</p>"
